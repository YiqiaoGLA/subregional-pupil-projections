# this function works mostly the same as my other functions to aggregate geographies, such as aggregate_geographies_2 (which is in the same folder). 
# the difference with this function is that it is not designed simply for mapping lower geographies to higher geographies.
# it is designed for dealing with splits and mergings of geographies over time, which need to be mapped to a common geography and then aggregated to that common geography. 
# the first major input is a dataset, with multiple time periods, with geographies to be corrected. The second major input is a lookup, that contains only the geographies to be corrected, not all geographies (although it can contain all geographies and will still work just fine).
